      SUBROUTINE BSAFY4X (C, TLE, SURFACE, NX, X, Y, LUNERR, IER)
C
C ONE-LINER: B-Spline AirFoil evaluation of Y for given X(s) (one surface)
C            - -      -  -                  - -         -
C PURPOSE:
C
C        BSAFY4X discretizes ONE surface of an airfoil, given in DT_NURBS
C     B-spline curve form, at specified X abscissa(s) as opposed to given
C     (or generated) values of parametric variable T.  See also BSAF2XY.
C
C METHOD:
C
C        The B-spline curve should represent the airfoil in clockwise
C     wrap-around form, from lower trailing edge to upper trailing edge.
C     Unless TLE is input (not 999.), general purpose utility BSZEROMN
C     is used to locate it as the value of the parametric variable T
C     corresponding to the leading edge.  Then the interval [T1, TLE]
C     or [TLE, TN], depending on SURFACE, is used with BSEVAL to estimate
C     the Y for each X, where T1 and TN are the first and last knots.
C
C        The leading edge point presents a problem: estimating its Y from
C     its X via BSEVAL could well fail because of round-off difficulties.
C     Therefore, if the smallest X is arbitrarily close to the leading edge
C     as determined from TLE, then the corresponding Y is determined from
C     TLE, not this X.

      INTEGER

      REAL
     >   EPS, FLAG, ZERO
      PARAMETER
     >  (MAXK    = 7,              ! Local storage handles polynomial deg. <= 6

C     Local variables
C     ---------------

      INTEGER
     >   I1, I2, IMIN
      REAL
     >   DUM, T1, T2, TA, TB, WORK (NWORK), XY (2)

C     Execution
C     ---------

      I2 = 5 + INT (C (3) + C (4))
      T2 = C (I2)                      ! Last knot
      T1 = C (6)                       ! First knot

      IF (TLE .EQ. FLAG) THEN

C        Find the leading edge value of T by minimizing X w.r.t. T:

         CALL BSZEROMN ('MIN', 1, C, T1, T2, TLE, XY, LUNERR, IER)
         IF (IER .NE. 0) GO TO 800

      ELSE

C        We still need X and Y at the leading edge as functions of TLE:

         CALL DTSPVL (TLE, C, WORK, NWORK, XY, IER)
         IF (IER .NE. 0) GO TO 810

      END IF

C     Avoiding the leading edge X among the main evaluations makes
C     for some awkward gyrations:

      IF (X (1) .LT. X (NX)) THEN
         IMIN = 1
      ELSE
         IMIN = NX
      END IF

      IF (ABS (X (IMIN) - XY (1)) .LT. EPS * (X (1) + X (NX))) THEN
         Y (IMIN) = XY (2)      ! Leading edge Y
         IF (IMIN .EQ. 1) THEN
            I1 = 2
            I2 = NX
         ELSE
            I1 = 1
            I2 = NX - 1
         END IF
      ELSE
         I1 = 1
         I2 = NX
      END IF

C     Distinguish the surfaces:

      IF (SURFACE (1:1) .EQ. 'L') THEN
         TA = T1
         TB = TLE
      ELSE
         TA = TLE
         TB = T2
      END IF


C     Evaluate Y at each X:

      CALL BSEVAL ('Y', C, .TRUE., I2 - I1 + 1, X (I1), TA, TB, DUM,
     >             Y (I1), LUNERR, IER)
      IF (IER. NE. 0) GO TO 820

      GO TO 999


C     Error handling.

  800 WRITE (LUNERR, 1010) 'BSZEROMN', IER
      GO TO 999
      
  810 WRITE (LUNERR, 1010) 'DTSPVL', IER
      GO TO 999

  820 WRITE (LUNERR, 1010) 'BSEVAL', IER


  999 RETURN

C     Formats.

 1010 FORMAT ('0BSAFY4X: Bad return from ', A, '.  IER: ', I4)

      END
