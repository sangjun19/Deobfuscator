Description:
You will define an enumeration for the days of the week starting with Sunday as 0 and ending with Saturday as 6. The program should read a list of integers from the user, map them to the corresponding days, and print the days in reverse order.

Input Format:

An integer
ùëõ
n representing the number of days.
A list of
