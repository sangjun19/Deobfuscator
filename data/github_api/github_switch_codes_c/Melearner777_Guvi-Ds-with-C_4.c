/*Complex Menu Navigation using Switch Statement
Problem Statement:
Write a C program that simulates a menu-driven application for a library management system using the switch statement. The menu should offer the following options:

Add a book
Display books
Search for a book by title
Exit
The twist is that each option should lead to a submenu with additional choices. For example, the "Add a book" option should allow the user to enter the title, author, and year of publication. The "Display books" option should display all books in a specific format. The "Search for a book by title" option should allow for a partial title search.

Description:

The program should use the switch statement to handle the main menu and each submenu.
Implement functions for each submenu operation.
Use dynamic memory allocation to store book details.
Use a struct to represent each book.

Input Format:

The user inputs the menu choice followed by submenu choices as required.
The input ends when the user selects the "Exit" option.

Output Format:

The output varies based on the selected menu and submenu options, including confirmation messages and book details.

The below are the output for corresponding operation:

Add a book:

Book added successfully.

Display books:

Case1:

No books in the library.

Case2:

Books in library:
Title: < Title >, Author: < Author >, Year: < Year >

Seach for a book by title:

Case1:

No book found with the given title.

Case2:

Books found:
Title: < Title >, Author: < Author >, Year: < Year >

Exit

Exiting...
