(**---------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  This module provides simple, data-stream-oriented input. The source of input 
  can be from the keyboard or from a file. The input from a file is especially
  useful for the program development as input test data can be prepared and 
  saved in a file. This file is then selected as input source after each
  program start to run a complete test.
  
  The interface of this module is call-compatible with the standard stated in 
  the Oakwood Guidelines [OAK93] for a data-stream-oriented input module.
  If the input is made from a file the latter can be selected in a pop-up dialog. 
  This file is then read character by character, according to the input functions 
  that are called. As this must be a text file an input file can be created with 
  any text editor. In case of input functions like LongInt the procedure reads 
  from the file until a character is detected that does not conform to the rules 
  defined in the EBNF syntax. Leading blanks, tabulators, and CR and LF 
  characters are neglected, with the sole exception of Char.

  When the program is started the keyboard is the default input medium. With 
  the menu "Pane" it is possible to switch to a file as input source at any 
  time.
  
  The end of a keyboard input stream is indicated by pressing the "End" key. 
  When using a file as input source the end of the input stream is signalled 
  by the end of file.
