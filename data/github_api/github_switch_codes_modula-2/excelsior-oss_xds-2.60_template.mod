 *  File name  :  Template.mod
 *
 *  Description:  This application serves as a template than can be
 *                modified by an application developer.  The source
 *                files are organized so that the overhead code, which
 *                should be in all applications, is located in the same
 *                files, so that these files do not need to be modified.
 *                The routines that deal with application-specific code
 *                are also locatedin their own modules.  An application
 *                developer need only change these files in order to
 *                modify this template for his application.
 *
 *                This source file contains the top-level module
 *                of the application, which body serves as the main
 *                routine.

 *  Included in the sample template is code that creates a

 *  To use this thread, toggle the BACKGROUND_THREAD option ON
 *  in the project file. This will enable the routines that
 *  create and destroy the background processing thread.
 *  The routines for the thread itself are located in the
 *  "thrd" module.

 *  NOTE: Do not forget to switch the MULTITHREAD option ON
 *        to link with the multithread version of the library.

 *  Description: Initializes the PM environment, calls the

 *
 *  Concepts:    - obtains anchor block handle and creates message
 *                    queue
 *               - calls the initialization routine
 *               - creates the main frame window which creates the
 *                    main client window
 *               - polls the message queue via Get/Dispatch Msg loop
 *               - upon exiting the loop, exits
