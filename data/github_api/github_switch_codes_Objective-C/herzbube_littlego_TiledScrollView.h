/// @brief The TiledScrollView class decomposes its content into tiles that all
/// have the same fixed size. When the user zooms in or out, each tile draws its
/// part of the content at the new resolution.
///
/// The purpose of tiling is to keep memory usage at a low level regardless of
/// the current zoom scale. This is achieved because TiledScrollView displays
/// only those tiles that are currently visible in its bounds rectangle. Given
/// a constant bounds size, TiledScrollView therefore never requires more than
/// a certain maximum number of tiles - which directly translates into a certain
/// maximum amount of memory to draw these tiles. Without tiling, at higher zoom
/// scales a single content view requires a large amount of memory to draw the
/// entire content, even those content parts that are currently not visible.
///
/// As tradeoff, tiling requires more CPU performance when the content is
/// scrolled, because tiles constantly need to be swapped in/out while the
/// visible bounds rectangle of TiledScrollView scrolls over the zoomed content.
/// TiledScrollView tries to strike a balance between memory and CPU usage by
/// placing tiles that are no longer visible into a "reusable queue" from where
/// they can be taken by TiledScrollViewDataSource when a new tile is requested.
/// This is the same mechanism as in the well-known class UITableView.
///
///
/// @par Maximum number of tiles
///
/// The maximum number of tiles is a function of
/// - The bounds size of TiledScrollView
/// - The tile size
///
/// The formula for calculating the maximum number of tiles is this:
///   ceilf(boundsSize.width / tileSize.width) * ceilf(boundsSize.height / tileSize.height)
///
///
/// @par Credits
///
/// This class is a complete rewrite of the TiledScrollView class from the
/// Tiling example in the ScrollViewSuite sample code project provided by
/// Apple. The original code included handling for switching between different
/// resolutions of an image, this handling is not present in this implementation
/// because the content displayed is not an image but arbitrary artifacts
/// custom-drawn with CoreGraphics.
///
/// The original demo code can be found here:
/// https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/samplecode/ScrollViewSuite/Introduction/Intro.html
