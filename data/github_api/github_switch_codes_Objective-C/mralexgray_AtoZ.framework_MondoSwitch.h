  This class emulates a switch component.  Switches are used quite often in the iPhone interface but are not available on the Mac OS X platform.
  Apple does use a switch for the Time Machine interface but the control is not available in interface builder.

  A switch control is more natural in an iPhone interface than the Mac desktop.
  So, please don't abuse this control and replace all your checkboxes with switches.  Use common sense.  
  A good guideline is to use a switch for a desktop application when the state of the switch has far reaching implications.
  For example: The switch disables or enables the core functionality of the application.

  Sizing note: The Time Machine Switch on 10.6.2 has a sizing of 93px wide and 27px height. the internal switch is 40px wide or
