# mach.d

A general-purpose library for the D programming language, made with game
development in mind.

This library is distributed under the very permissive
[zlib/libpng license](https://github.com/pineapplemachine/mach.d/blob/master/license).
In short: You may do nearly anything you like with this software, provided you
don't misrepresent its origin.

Be warned: This library is not yet mature, and I am constantly rewriting and
improving and occassionally breaking code. That being said, I take some pride
in the thoroughness of this library's unit tests.
Said tests are frequently verified on Windows 7 and occassionally on OSX 10.9.5.
(Eventually, I'll get around to setting up an automated build process that
regularly tests on as many platforms as possible.)

## Dependencies

The majority of this package depends only on the druntime and D's standard library,
Phobos, and I'm working on cutting out the remaining Phobos dependencies.

## Usage

The `mach` folder should be placed where you are loading dependencies from.
In the case of **dmd** or **rdmd**, this is a directory passed using the `-I` argument.
In the case of **dub**, this is a path added to a project using `dub add-path`.

Beware compiling mach with the `-unittest` flag when linking on Windows with Optlink;
[a bug with Optlink](https://issues.dlang.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17077) causes
the compilation to fail with a linker error.
To compile on Windows with unit tests, the `-m32mscoff` switch must be passed
to dmd/rdmd, and a version of Visual Studio including the linker must be
available on the system.

See the [examples directory](https://github.com/pineapplemachine/mach.d/tree/master/examples)
for example programs showing how to use mach's functionality.

## Places of interest

To output to the console and read user input,
[`mach.io.stdio`](https://github.com/pineapplemachine/mach.d/blob/master/mach/io/stdio.d).

To read and write files, and to perform other file system operations,
[`mach.io.file.path`](https://github.com/pineapplemachine/mach.d/blob/master/mach/io/file/path.d).

For higher-order functions and other functional programming tools,
[`mach.range`](https://github.com/pineapplemachine/mach.d/tree/master/mach/range).

To generate a string representation of just about anything,
[`mach.text.str`](https://github.com/pineapplemachine/mach.d/tree/master/mach/text/str).

To encode and decode UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32,
[`mach.text.utf`](https://github.com/pineapplemachine/mach.d/tree/master/mach/text/utf).

To parse and encode JSON,
[`mach.json`](https://github.com/pineapplemachine/mach.d/tree/master/mach/text/json).

For collections and related data structures,
[`mach.collect`](https://github.com/pineapplemachine/mach.d/tree/master/mach/collect).

## Differences from Phobos

Major departures from Phobos' school of thought include:

### No auto-decoding strings

The mach library does not give special treatment to character strings.
Unless otherwise specified, the functions defined throughout the library
will treat an array of chars or wchars as just that - an an array of chars
(or wchars).
The `mach.text.utf` module provides `utfencode` and `utfdecode` functions
which should be called to explicitly encode and decode UTF strings.

+/

unittest{
    import mach.text : utfdecode;
    import mach.range : walklength;
    string str = "\xE3\x83\x84";
    assert(str.length == 3);
    auto decoded = str.utfdecode;
    assert(decoded.front == 'ãƒ„');
    assert(decoded.walklength == 1);
}

/++ md

### Arrays aren't ranges

Functions in this library do not necessarily accept _ranges_,
they accept types which are _valid as ranges_.
The distinction becomes most significant when working with arrays.
Functions which accept ranges also accept types with an `asrange` property
which returns an actual range. There are default `asrange` implementations
for several types, including static and dynamic arrays,
which functions throughout this library rely on to get a range
from an inputted iterable when only a range will do.

+/

unittest{
    import mach.range : asrange, filter, equals;
    // An array - but not a range
    int[] array = [0, 1, 2, 3];
    // A range which iterates over an array
    auto range = array.asrange;
    // Functions in this library accept either one: A range, or a type which
    // is valid as a range via the `asrange` property, including arrays.
    auto arrayfilter = array.filter!(n => n % 2);
    auto rangefilter = range.filter!(n => n % 2);
    assert(arrayfilter.equals(rangefilter));
}

/++ md

Other types can become similarly valid as ranges by giving them an `asrange` method.
With this other collections can become valid as ranges, too,
such as the doubly-linked list type defined in `mach.collect`.

+/

unittest{
    import mach.collect : DoublyLinkedList;
    import mach.range : filter, equals;
    auto list = new DoublyLinkedList!int([0, 1, 2, 3]);
    assert(list.filter!(n => n % 2).equals([1, 3]));
}

### Ranges are not "moving windows"

In Phobos, ranges are conceptualized as moving windows over some source of data.
In mach, ranges are as stationary windows with a moving cursor or, in the case of
bidirectional ranges, a pair of moving cursors.

The indexes referred to via opIndex and opSlice remain consistent
even while consuming the range, as does length.

+/

unittest{
    import mach.range : asrange;
    auto range = "hello".asrange;
    assert(range.length == 5);
    assert(range[0] == 'h');
    range.popFront();
    assert(range.length == 5);
    assert(range[0] == 'h');
}

/++ md

To get the number of elements remaining in a range, as the `length` property
does in Phobos, ranges in this library support a `remaining` property
which returns the number of elements the range will still iterate over.

+/

unittest{
    import mach.range : asrange;
    auto range = "hello".asrange;
    assert(range.remaining == 5);
    range.popFront();
    assert(range.remaining == 4);
}
