  continue playback. With this seek method it is possible to perform seamless
  looping or simple linear editing.
  
  When only changing the playback rate and not the direction, the
  [gst.types.SeekFlags.InstantRateChange] flag can be used for a non-flushing seek
  to signal that the rate change should be applied immediately. This requires
  special support in the seek handlers (e.g. demuxers) and any elements
  synchronizing to the clock, and in general can't work in all cases (for example
  UDP streaming where the delivery rate is controlled by a remote server). The
  instant-rate-change mode supports changing the trickmode-related GST_SEEK_ flags,
  but can't be used in conjunction with other seek flags that affect the new
  playback position - as the playback position will not be changing.
  
  When doing fast forward (rate > 1.0) or fast reverse (rate < -1.0) trickmode
  playback, the [gst.types.SeekFlags.Trickmode] flag can be used to instruct decoders
  and demuxers to adjust the playback rate by skipping frames. This can improve
  performance and decrease CPU usage because not all frames need to be decoded.
  
  Beyond that, the [gst.types.SeekFlags.TrickmodeKeyUnits] flag can be used to
  request that decoders skip all frames except key units, and
  [gst.types.SeekFlags.TrickmodeNoAudio] flags can be used to request that audio
  decoders do no decoding at all, and simple output silence.
  
  The [gst.types.SeekFlags.SnapBefore] flag can be used to snap to the previous
  relevant location, and the [gst.types.SeekFlags.SnapAfter] flag can be used to
  select the next relevant location. If [gst.types.SeekFlags.KeyUnit] is specified,
  the relevant location is a keyframe. If both flags are specified, the nearest
  of these locations will be selected. If none are specified, the implementation is
  free to select whichever it wants.
  
  The before and after here are in running time, so when playing backwards,
  the next location refers to the one that will played in next, and not the
  one that is located after in the actual source stream.
  
  Also see part-seeking.txt in the GStreamer design documentation for more
  details on the meaning of these flags and the behaviour expected of
  elements that handle them.

/**
    #GstBin is an element that can contain other #GstElement, allowing them to be
  managed as a group.
  Pads from the child elements can be ghosted to the bin, see #GstGhostPad.
  This makes the bin look like any other elements and enables creation of
  higher-level abstraction elements.
  
  A new #GstBin is created with [gst.bin.Bin.new_]. Use a #GstPipeline instead if you
  want to create a toplevel bin because a normal bin doesn't have a bus or
  handle clock distribution of its own.
  
  After the bin has been created you will typically add elements to it with
  [gst.bin.Bin.add]. You can remove elements with [gst.bin.Bin.remove].
  
  An element can be retrieved from a bin with [gst.bin.Bin.getByName], using the
  elements name. [gst.bin.Bin.getByNameRecurseUp] is mainly used for internal
  purposes and will query the parent bins when the element is not found in the
  current bin.
  
  An iterator of elements in a bin can be retrieved with
  [gst.bin.Bin.iterateElements]. Various other iterators exist to retrieve the
  elements in a bin.
  
  [gst.object.ObjectGst.unref] is used to drop your reference to the bin.
  
  The #GstBin::element-added signal is fired whenever a new element is added to
  the bin. Likewise the #GstBin::element-removed signal is fired whenever an
  element is removed from the bin.
  
  A #GstBin internally intercepts every #GstMessage posted by its children and
  implements the following default behaviour for each of them:
  
  $(LIST
    * [gst.types.MessageType.Eos]: This message is only posted by sinks in the PLAYING
  )
  state. If all sinks posted the EOS message, this bin will post and EOS
  message upwards.
  
  $(LIST
    * [gst.types.MessageType.SegmentStart]: Just collected and never forwarded upwards.
      The messages are used to decide when all elements have completed playback
      of their segment.
    
    * [gst.types.MessageType.SegmentDone]: Is posted by #GstBin when all elements that posted
      a SEGMENT_START have posted a SEGMENT_DONE.
    
    * [gst.types.MessageType.DurationChanged]: Is posted by an element that detected a change
      in the stream duration. The duration change is posted to the
      application so that it can refetch the new duration with a duration
      query.
    
      Note that these messages can be posted before the bin is prerolled, in which
      case the duration query might fail.
    
      Note also that there might be a discrepancy (due to internal buffering/queueing)
      between the stream being currently displayed and the returned duration query.
    
      Applications might want to also query for duration (and changes) by
      listening to the [gst.types.MessageType.StreamStart] message, signaling the active start
      of a (new) stream.
    
    * [gst.types.MessageType.ClockLost]: This message is posted by an element when it
      can no longer provide a clock.
    
      The default bin behaviour is to check if the lost clock was the one provided
      by the bin. If so and the bin is currently in the PLAYING state, the message
      is forwarded to the bin parent.
    
      This message is also generated when a clock provider is removed from
      the bin. If this message is received by the application, it should
      PAUSE the pipeline and set it back to PLAYING to force a new clock
      distribution.
    
    * [gst.types.MessageType.ClockProvide]: This message is generated when an element
      can provide a clock. This mostly happens when a new clock
      provider is added to the bin.
    
      The default behaviour of the bin is to mark the currently selected clock as
      dirty, which will perform a clock recalculation the next time the bin is
      asked to provide a clock.
    
      This message is never sent to the application but is forwarded to
      the parent of the bin.
    
    * OTHERS: posted upwards.
  )
    
  A #GstBin implements the following default behaviour for answering to a
  #GstQuery:
  
  $(LIST
    * [gst.types.QueryType.Duration]: The bin will forward the query to all sink
      elements contained within and will return the maximum value.
      If no sinks are available in the bin, the query fails.
    
    * [gst.types.QueryType.Position]: The query is sent to all sink elements in the bin and the
      MAXIMUM of all values is returned. If no sinks are available in the bin,
      the query fails.
    
    * OTHERS: the query is forwarded to all sink elements, the result
      of the first sink that answers the query successfully is returned. If no
      sink is in the bin, the query fails.
  )
    
  A #GstBin will by default forward any event sent to it to all sink
  ( [gst.types.EventTypeFlags.Upstream] ) or source ( [gst.types.EventTypeFlags.Downstream] ) elements
  depending on the event type.
  
  If all the elements return true, the bin will also return true, else false
  is returned. If no elements of the required type are in the bin, the event
  handler will return true.

/**
    Buffers are the basic unit of data transfer in GStreamer. They contain the
  timing and offset along with other arbitrary metadata that is associated
  with the #GstMemory blocks that the buffer contains.
  
  Buffers are usually created with [gst.buffer.Buffer.new_]. After a buffer has been
  created one will typically allocate memory for it and add it to the buffer.
  The following example creates a buffer that can hold a given video frame
  with a given width, height and bits per plane.
  
  ``` C
    GstBuffer *buffer;
    GstMemory *memory;
    gint size, width, height, bpp;
    ...
    size = width * height * bpp;
    buffer = gst_buffer_new ();
    memory = gst_allocator_alloc (NULL, size, NULL);
    gst_buffer_insert_memory (buffer, -1, memory);
    ...
  ```
  
  Alternatively, use [gst.buffer.Buffer.newAllocate] to create a buffer with
  preallocated data of a given size.
  
  Buffers can contain a list of #GstMemory objects. You can retrieve how many
  memory objects with [gst.buffer.Buffer.nMemory] and you can get a pointer
  to memory with [gst.buffer.Buffer.peekMemory]
  
  A buffer will usually have timestamps, and a duration, but neither of these
  are guaranteed (they may be set to #GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE). Whenever a
  meaningful value can be given for these, they should be set. The timestamps
  and duration are measured in nanoseconds (they are #GstClockTime values).
  
  The buffer DTS refers to the timestamp when the buffer should be decoded and
  is usually monotonically increasing. The buffer PTS refers to the timestamp when
  the buffer content should be presented to the user and is not always
  monotonically increasing.
  
  A buffer can also have one or both of a start and an end offset. These are
  media-type specific. For video buffers, the start offset will generally be
  the frame number. For audio buffers, it will be the number of samples
  produced so far. For compressed data, it could be the byte offset in a
  source or destination file. Likewise, the end offset will be the offset of
  the end of the buffer. These can only be meaningfully interpreted if you
  know the media type of the buffer (the preceding CAPS event). Either or both
  can be set to #GST_BUFFER_OFFSET_NONE.
  
  gst_buffer_ref() is used to increase the refcount of a buffer. This must be
  done when you want to keep a handle to the buffer after pushing it to the
  next element. The buffer refcount determines the writability of the buffer, a
  buffer is only writable when the refcount is exactly 1, i.e. when the caller
  has the only reference to the buffer.
  
  To efficiently create a smaller buffer out of an existing one, you can
  use [gst.buffer.Buffer.copyRegion]. This method tries to share the memory objects
  between the two buffers.
  
  If a plug-in wants to modify the buffer data or metadata in-place, it should
  first obtain a buffer that is safe to modify by using
  gst_buffer_make_writable(). This function is optimized so that a copy will
  only be made when it is necessary.
  
  Several flags of the buffer can be set and unset with the
  GST_BUFFER_FLAG_SET() and GST_BUFFER_FLAG_UNSET() macros. Use
  GST_BUFFER_FLAG_IS_SET() to test if a certain #GstBufferFlags flag is set.
  
  Buffers can be efficiently merged into a larger buffer with
  [gst.buffer.Buffer.append]. Copying of memory will only be done when absolutely
  needed.
  
  Arbitrary extra metadata can be set on a buffer with [gst.buffer.Buffer.addMeta].
  Metadata can be retrieved with [gst.buffer.Buffer.getMeta]. See also #GstMeta.
  
  An element should either unref the buffer or push it out on a src pad
  using [gst.pad.Pad.push] (see #GstPad).
  
  Buffers are usually freed by unreffing them with gst_buffer_unref(). When
  the refcount drops to 0, any memory and metadata pointed to by the buffer is
  unreffed as well. Buffers allocated from a #GstBufferPool will be returned to
  the pool when the refcount drops to 0.
  
  The #GstParentBufferMeta is a meta which can be attached to a #GstBuffer
  to hold a reference to another buffer that is only released when the child
  #GstBuffer is released.
  
  Typically, #GstParentBufferMeta is used when the child buffer is directly
  using the #GstMemory of the parent buffer, and wants to prevent the parent
  buffer from being returned to a buffer pool until the #GstMemory is available
  for re-use. (Since: 1.6)

  possible to handle the delivery in the glib #GMainLoop.
  
  The #GSource callback function [gst.bus.Bus.asyncSignalFunc] can be used to
  convert all bus messages into signal emissions.
  
  A message is posted on the bus with the [gst.bus.Bus.post] method. With the
  [gst.bus.Bus.peek] and [gst.bus.Bus.pop] methods one can look at or retrieve a
  previously posted message.
  
  The bus can be polled with the [gst.bus.Bus.poll] method. This methods blocks
  up to the specified timeout value until one of the specified messages types
  is posted on the bus. The application can then [gst.bus.Bus.pop] the messages
  from the bus to handle them.
  Alternatively the application can register an asynchronous bus function
  using [gst.bus.Bus.addWatchFull] or [gst.bus.Bus.addWatch]. This function will
  install a #GSource in the default glib main loop and will deliver messages
  a short while after they have been posted. Note that the main loop should
  be running for the asynchronous callbacks.
  
  It is also possible to get messages from the bus without any thread
  marshalling with the [gst.bus.Bus.setSyncHandler] method. This makes it
  possible to react to a message in the same thread that posted the
  message on the bus. This should only be used if the application is able
  to deal with messages from different threads.
  
  Every #GstPipeline has one bus.
  
  Note that a #GstPipeline will set its bus into flushing state when changing
  from READY to NULL state.

    Caps (capabilities) are lightweight refcounted objects describing media types.
  They are composed of an array of #GstStructure.
  
  Caps are exposed on #GstPadTemplate to describe all possible types a
  given pad can handle. They are also stored in the #GstRegistry along with
  a description of the #GstElement.
  
  Caps are exposed on the element pads using the [gst.pad.Pad.queryCaps] pad
  function. This function describes the possible types that the pad can
  handle or produce at runtime.
  
  A #GstCaps can be constructed with the following code fragment:
  
  ``` C
    GstCaps *caps = gst_caps_new_simple ("video/x-raw",
       "format", G_TYPE_STRING, "I420",
       "framerate", GST_TYPE_FRACTION, 25, 1,
       "pixel-aspect-ratio", GST_TYPE_FRACTION, 1, 1,
       "width", G_TYPE_INT, 320,
       "height", G_TYPE_INT, 240,
       NULL);
  ```
  
  A #GstCaps is fixed when it has no fields with ranges or lists. Use
  [gst.caps.Caps.isFixed] to test for fixed caps. Fixed caps can be used in a
  caps event to notify downstream elements of the current media type.
  
  Various methods exist to work with the media types such as subtracting
  or intersecting.
  
  Be aware that until 1.20 the #GstCaps / #GstStructure serialization into string
  had limited support for nested #GstCaps / #GstStructure fields. It could only
  support one level of nesting. Using more levels would lead to unexpected
  behavior when using serialization features, such as [gst.caps.Caps.toString_] or
  [gst.global.valueSerialize] and their counterparts.

/**
    GStreamer uses a global clock to synchronize the plugins in a pipeline.
  Different clock implementations are possible by implementing this abstract
  base class or, more conveniently, by subclassing #GstSystemClock.
  
  The #GstClock returns a monotonically increasing time with the method
  [gst.clock.Clock.getTime]. Its accuracy and base time depend on the specific
  clock implementation but time is always expressed in nanoseconds. Since the
  baseline of the clock is undefined, the clock time returned is not
  meaningful in itself, what matters are the deltas between two clock times.
  The time returned by a clock is called the absolute time.
  
  The pipeline uses the clock to calculate the running time. Usually all
  renderers synchronize to the global clock using the buffer timestamps, the
  #GST_EVENT_SEGMENT events and the element's base time, see #GstPipeline.
  
  A clock implementation can support periodic and single shot clock
  notifications both synchronous and asynchronous.
  
  One first needs to create a #GstClockID for the periodic or single shot
  notification using [gst.clock.Clock.newSingleShotId] or
  [gst.clock.Clock.newPeriodicId].
  
  To perform a blocking wait for the specific time of the #GstClockID use
  [gst.clock.Clock.idWait]. To receive a callback when the specific time is reached
  in the clock use [gst.clock.Clock.idWaitAsync]. Both these calls can be
  interrupted with the [gst.clock.Clock.idUnschedule] call. If the blocking wait is
  unscheduled a return value of #GST_CLOCK_UNSCHEDULED is returned.
  
  Periodic callbacks scheduled async will be repeatedly called automatically
  until they are unscheduled. To schedule a sync periodic callback,
  [gst.clock.Clock.idWait] should be called repeatedly.
  
  The async callbacks can happen from any thread, either provided by the core
  or from a streaming thread. The application should be prepared for this.
  
  A #GstClockID that has been unscheduled cannot be used again for any wait
  operation, a new #GstClockID should be created and the old unscheduled one
  should be destroyed with [gst.clock.Clock.idUnref].
  
  It is possible to perform a blocking wait on the same #GstClockID from
  multiple threads. However, registering the same #GstClockID for multiple
  async notifications is not possible, the callback will only be called for
  the thread registering the entry last.
  
  None of the wait operations unref the #GstClockID, the owner is responsible
  for unreffing the ids itself. This holds for both periodic and single shot
  notifications. The reason being that the owner of the #GstClockID has to
  keep a handle to the #GstClockID to unblock the wait on FLUSHING events or
  state changes and if the entry would be unreffed automatically, the handle
  might become invalid without any notification.
  
  These clock operations do not operate on the running time, so the callbacks
  will also occur when not in PLAYING state as if the clock just keeps on
  running. Some clocks however do not progress when the element that provided
  the clock is not PLAYING.
  
  When a clock has the #GST_CLOCK_FLAG_CAN_SET_MASTER flag set, it can be
  slaved to another #GstClock with [gst.clock.Clock.setMaster]. The clock will
  then automatically be synchronized to this master clock by repeatedly
  sampling the master clock and the slave clock and recalibrating the slave
  clock with [gst.clock.Clock.setCalibration]. This feature is mostly useful for
  plugins that have an internal clock but must operate with another clock
  selected by the #GstPipeline.  They can track the offset and rate difference
  of their internal clock relative to the master clock by using the
  [gst.clock.Clock.getCalibration] function.
  
  The master/slave synchronisation can be tuned with the #GstClock:timeout,
  #GstClock:window-size and #GstClock:window-threshold properties.
  The #GstClock:timeout property defines the interval to sample the master
  clock and run the calibration functions. #GstClock:window-size defines the
  number of samples to use when calibrating and #GstClock:window-threshold
  defines the minimum number of samples before the calibration is performed.

    #GstContext is a container object used to store contexts like a device
  context, a display server connection and similar concepts that should

  Applications can set a context on a complete pipeline by using
  [gst.element.Element.setContext], which will then be propagated to all
  child elements. Elements can handle these in #GstElementClass::set_context
  and merge them with the context information they already have.
  
  When an element needs a context it will do the following actions in this
  order until one step succeeds:
  
  1. Check if the element already has a context
  2. Query downstream with [gst.types.QueryType.Context] for the context
  3. Query upstream with [gst.types.QueryType.Context] for the context
  4. Post a [gst.types.MessageType.NeedContext] message on the bus with the required
     context types and afterwards check if a usable context was set now
  5. Create a context by itself and post a [gst.types.MessageType.HaveContext] message
     on the bus.
  
  Bins will catch [gst.types.MessageType.NeedContext] messages and will set any previously
  known context on the element that asks for it if possible. Otherwise the
  application should provide one if it can.
  
  #GstContext can be persistent.
  A persistent #GstContext is kept in elements when they reach

/**
    GstElement is the abstract base class needed to construct an element that
  can be used in a GStreamer pipeline. Please refer to the plugin writers
  guide for more information on creating #GstElement subclasses.
  
  The name of a #GstElement can be get with gst_element_get_name() and set with
  gst_element_set_name().  For speed, GST_ELEMENT_NAME() can be used in the
  core when using the appropriate locking. Do not use this in plug-ins or
  applications in order to retain ABI compatibility.
  
  Elements can have pads (of the type #GstPad).  These pads link to pads on
  other elements.  #GstBuffer flow between these linked pads.
  A #GstElement has a #GList of #GstPad structures for all their input (or sink)
  and output (or source) pads.
  Core and plug-in writers can add and remove pads with [gst.element.Element.addPad]
  and [gst.element.Element.removePad].
  
  An existing pad of an element can be retrieved by name with
  [gst.element.Element.getStaticPad]. A new dynamic pad can be created using
  [gst.element.Element.requestPad] with a #GstPadTemplate.
  An iterator of all pads can be retrieved with [gst.element.Element.iteratePads].
  
  Elements can be linked through their pads.
  If the link is straightforward, use the [gst.element.Element.link]
  convenience function to link two elements, or [gst.element.Element.linkMany]
  for more elements in a row.
  Use [gst.element.Element.linkFiltered] to link two elements constrained by
  a specified set of #GstCaps.
  For finer control, use [gst.element.Element.linkPads] and
  [gst.element.Element.linkPadsFiltered] to specify the pads to link on
  each element by name.
  
  Each element has a state (see #GstState).  You can get and set the state
  of an element with [gst.element.Element.getState] and [gst.element.Element.setState].
  Setting a state triggers a #GstStateChange. To get a string representation
  of a #GstState, use [gst.element.Element.stateGetName].
  
  You can get and set a #GstClock on an element using [gst.element.Element.getClock]
  and [gst.element.Element.setClock].
  Some elements can provide a clock for the pipeline if
  the #GST_ELEMENT_FLAG_PROVIDE_CLOCK flag is set. With the
  [gst.element.Element.provideClock] method one can retrieve the clock provided by
  such an element.
  Not all elements require a clock to operate correctly. If the
  #GST_ELEMENT_FLAG_REQUIRE_CLOCK() flag is set, a clock should be set on the
  element with [gst.element.Element.setClock].
  
  Note that clock selection and distribution is normally handled by the
  toplevel #GstPipeline so the clock functions are only to be used in very
  specific situations.

    The event class provides factory methods to construct events for sending
  and functions to query (parse) received events.
  
  Events are usually created with gst_event_new_*() which takes event-type
  specific parameters as arguments.
  To send an event application will usually use [gst.element.Element.sendEvent] and
  elements will use [gst.pad.Pad.sendEvent] or [gst.pad.Pad.pushEvent].
  The event should be unreffed with gst_event_unref() if it has not been sent.
  
  Events that have been received can be parsed with their respective
  gst_event_parse_*() functions. It is valid to pass null for unwanted details.
  
  Events are passed between elements in parallel to the data stream. Some events
  are serialized with buffers, others are not. Some events only travel downstream,
  others only upstream. Some events can travel both upstream and downstream.
  
  The events are used to signal special conditions in the datastream such as
  EOS (end of stream) or the start of a new stream-segment.
  Events are also used to flush the pipeline of any pending data.
  
  Most of the event API is used inside plugins. Applications usually only
  construct and use seek events.

  the needed parameters to specify seeking time and mode.

  Getting access to the data of the memory is performed with [gst.memory.Memory.map].
  The call will return a pointer to offset bytes into the region of memory.
  After the memory access is completed, [gst.memory.Memory.unmap] should be called.
  
  Memory can be copied with [gst.memory.Memory.copy], which will return a writable
  copy. [gst.memory.Memory.share] will create a new memory block that shares the

    #GstObject provides a root for the object hierarchy tree filed in by the
  GStreamer library.  It is currently a thin wrapper on top of
  #GInitiallyUnowned. It is an abstract class that is not very usable on its own.
  
  #GstObject gives us basic refcounting, parenting functionality and locking.
  Most of the functions are just extended for special GStreamer needs and can be
  found under the same name in the base class of #GstObject which is #GObject
  (e.g. [gobject.object.ObjectG.ref_] becomes [gst.object.ObjectGst.ref_]).
  
  Since #GstObject derives from #GInitiallyUnowned, it also inherits the
  floating reference. Be aware that functions such as [gst.bin.Bin.add] and
  [gst.element.Element.addPad] take ownership of the floating reference.
  
  In contrast to #GObject instances, #GstObject adds a name property. The functions
  [gst.object.ObjectGst.setName] and [gst.object.ObjectGst.getName] are used to set/get the name
  of the object.
  
  ## controlled properties
  
  Controlled properties offers a lightweight way to adjust gobject properties
  over stream-time. It works by using time-stamped value pairs that are queued
  for element-properties. At run-time the elements continuously pull value
  changes for the current stream-time.
  
  What needs to be changed in a #GstElement?
  Very little - it is just two steps to make a plugin controllable!
  
    $(LIST
        * mark gobject-properties paramspecs that make sense to be controlled,
          by GST_PARAM_CONTROLLABLE.

          gst_object_sync_values(element,timestamp).
          This will make the controller update all GObject properties that are
          under its control with the current values based on the timestamp.
    )
      
  What needs to be done in applications? Again it's not a lot to change.

    A #GstElement is linked to other elements via "pads", which are extremely
  light-weight generic link points.
  
  Pads have a #GstPadDirection, source pads produce data, sink pads consume
  data.
  
  Pads are typically created from a #GstPadTemplate with
  [gst.pad.Pad.newFromTemplate] and are then added to a #GstElement. This usually
  happens when the element is created but it can also happen dynamically based
  on the data that the element is processing or based on the pads that the
  application requests.
  
  Pads without pad templates can be created with [gst.pad.Pad.new_],
  which takes a direction and a name as an argument.  If the name is null,
  then a guaranteed unique name will be assigned to it.
  
  A #GstElement creating a pad will typically use the various
  gst_pad_set_*_function\() calls to register callbacks for events, queries or
  dataflow on the pads.
  
  gst_pad_get_parent() will retrieve the #GstElement that owns the pad.
  
  After two pads are retrieved from an element by [gst.element.Element.getStaticPad],
  the pads can be linked with [gst.pad.Pad.link]. (For quick links,
  you can also use [gst.element.Element.link], which will make the obvious
  link for you if it's straightforward.). Pads can be unlinked again with
  [gst.pad.Pad.unlink]. [gst.pad.Pad.getPeer] can be used to check what the pad is
  linked to.
  
  Before dataflow is possible on the pads, they need to be activated with
  [gst.pad.Pad.setActive].
  
  [gst.pad.Pad.query] and [gst.pad.Pad.peerQuery] can be used to query various
  properties of the pad and the stream.
  
  To send a #GstEvent on a pad, use [gst.pad.Pad.sendEvent] and
  [gst.pad.Pad.pushEvent]. Some events will be sticky on the pad, meaning that
  after they pass on the pad they can be queried later with
  [gst.pad.Pad.getStickyEvent] and [gst.pad.Pad.stickyEventsForeach].
  [gst.pad.Pad.getCurrentCaps] and [gst.pad.Pad.hasCurrentCaps] are convenience
  functions to query the current sticky CAPS event on a pad.
  
  GstElements will use [gst.pad.Pad.push] and [gst.pad.Pad.pullRange] to push out
  or pull in a buffer.
  
  The dataflow, events and queries that happen on a pad can be monitored with
  probes that can be installed with [gst.pad.Pad.addProbe]. [gst.pad.Pad.isBlocked]
  can be used to check if a block probe is installed on the pad.
  [gst.pad.Pad.isBlocking] checks if the blocking probe is currently blocking the
  pad. [gst.pad.Pad.removeProbe] is used to remove a previously installed probe
  and unblock blocking probes if any.
  
  Pad have an offset that can be retrieved with [gst.pad.Pad.getOffset]. This
  offset will be applied to the running_time of all data passing over the pad.
  [gst.pad.Pad.setOffset] can be used to change the offset.
  
  Convenience functions exist to start, pause and stop the task on a pad with
  [gst.pad.Pad.startTask], [gst.pad.Pad.pauseTask] and [gst.pad.Pad.stopTask]
  respectively.

/**
    Padtemplates describe the possible media types a pad or an elementfactory can
  handle. This allows for both inspection of handled types before loading the
  element plugin as well as identifying pads on elements that are not yet
  created (request or sometimes pads).
  
  Pad and PadTemplates have #GstCaps attached to it to describe the media type
  they are capable of dealing with. [gst.pad_template.PadTemplate.getCaps] or
  GST_PAD_TEMPLATE_CAPS() are used to get the caps of a padtemplate. It's not
  possible to modify the caps of a padtemplate after creation.
  
  PadTemplates have a #GstPadPresence property which identifies the lifetime
  of the pad and that can be retrieved with GST_PAD_TEMPLATE_PRESENCE(). Also
  the direction of the pad can be retrieved from the #GstPadTemplate with
  GST_PAD_TEMPLATE_DIRECTION().
  
  The GST_PAD_TEMPLATE_NAME_TEMPLATE () is important for GST_PAD_REQUEST pads
  because it has to be used as the name in the [gst.element.Element.requestPadSimple]
  call to instantiate a pad from this template.
  
  Padtemplates can be created with [gst.pad_template.PadTemplate.new_] or with
  gst_static_pad_template_get (), which creates a #GstPadTemplate from a
  #GstStaticPadTemplate that can be filled with the
  convenient GST_STATIC_PAD_TEMPLATE() macro.
  
  A padtemplate can be used to create a pad (see [gst.pad.Pad.newFromTemplate]
  or gst_pad_new_from_static_template ()) or to add to an element class
  (see gst_element_class_add_static_pad_template ()).
  
  The following code example shows the code to create a pad from a padtemplate.
  ```c
    GstStaticPadTemplate my_template =
    GST_STATIC_PAD_TEMPLATE (
      "sink",          // the name of the pad
      GST_PAD_SINK,    // the direction of the pad
      GST_PAD_ALWAYS,  // when this pad will be present
      GST_STATIC_CAPS (        // the capabilities of the padtemplate
        "audio/x-raw, "
          "channels = (int) [ 1, 6 ]"
      )
    );
    void
    my_method (void)
    {
      GstPad *pad;
      pad = gst_pad_new_from_static_template (&my_template, "sink");
      ...
    }
  ```
  
  The following example shows you how to add the padtemplate to an
  element class, this is usually done in the class_init of the class:
  ```c
    static void
    my_element_class_init (GstMyElementClass *klass)
    {
      GstElementClass *gstelement_class = GST_ELEMENT_CLASS (klass);
  
      gst_element_class_add_static_pad_template (gstelement_class, &my_template);
    }

    A #GstPipeline is a special #GstBin used as the toplevel container for
  the filter graph. The #GstPipeline will manage the selection and
  distribution of a global #GstClock as well as provide a #GstBus to the
  application.
  
  [gst.pipeline.Pipeline.new_] is used to create a pipeline. when you are done with
  the pipeline, use [gst.object.ObjectGst.unref] to free its resources including all
  added #GstElement objects (if not otherwise referenced).
  
  Elements are added and removed from the pipeline using the #GstBin
  methods like [gst.bin.Bin.add] and [gst.bin.Bin.remove] (see #GstBin).
  
  Before changing the state of the #GstPipeline (see #GstElement) a #GstBus
  should be retrieved with [gst.pipeline.Pipeline.getBus]. This #GstBus should then
  be used to receive #GstMessage from the elements in the pipeline. Listening
  to the #GstBus is necessary for retrieving error messages from the
  #GstPipeline and otherwise the #GstPipeline might stop without any
  indication, why. Furthermore, the #GstPipeline posts messages even if
  nobody listens on the #GstBus, which will pile up and use up memory.
  
  By default, a #GstPipeline will automatically flush the pending #GstBus
  messages when going to the NULL state to ensure that no circular
  references exist when no messages are read from the #GstBus. This
  behaviour can be changed with [gst.pipeline.Pipeline.setAutoFlushBus].
  
  When the #GstPipeline performs the PAUSED to PLAYING state change it will
  select a clock for the elements. The clock selection algorithm will by
  default select a clock provided by an element that is most upstream
  (closest to the source). For live pipelines (ones that return
  #GST_STATE_CHANGE_NO_PREROLL from the [gst.element.Element.setState] call) this
  will select the clock provided by the live source. For normal pipelines
  this will select a clock provided by the sinks (most likely the audio
  sink). If no element provides a clock, a default #GstSystemClock is used.
  
  The clock selection can be controlled with the [gst.pipeline.Pipeline.useClock]
  method, which will enforce a given clock on the pipeline. With
  [gst.pipeline.Pipeline.autoClock] the default clock selection algorithm can be
  restored.
  
  A #GstPipeline maintains a running time for the elements. The running
  time is defined as the difference between the current clock time and
  the base time. When the pipeline goes to READY or a flushing seek is
  performed on it, the running time is reset to 0. When the pipeline is
  set from PLAYING to PAUSED, the current clock time is sampled and used to
  configure the base time for the elements when the pipeline is set
  to PLAYING again. The effect is that the running time (as the difference
  between the clock time and the base time) will count how much time was spent
  in the PLAYING state. This default behaviour can be changed with the
  [gst.element.Element.setStartTime] method.

    This interface offers methods to query and manipulate parameter preset sets.
  A preset is a bunch of property settings, together with meta data and a name.
  The name of a preset serves as key for subsequent method calls to manipulate
  single presets.
  All instances of one type will share the list of presets. The list is created
  on demand, if presets are not used, the list is not created.
  
  The interface comes with a default implementation that serves most plugins.
  Wrapper plugins will override most methods to implement support for the
  native preset format of those wrapped plugins.
  One method that is useful to be overridden is [gst.preset.Preset.getPropertyNames].
  With that one can control which properties are saved and in which order.
  When implementing support for read-only presets, one should set the vmethods
  for [gst.preset.Preset.savePreset] and [gst.preset.Preset.deletePreset] to null.
  Applications can use [gst.preset.Preset.isEditable] to check for that.

/**
    The #GstPromise object implements the container for values that may
  be available later. i.e. a Future or a Promise in
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises>.
  As with all Future/Promise-like functionality, there is the concept of the
  producer of the value and the consumer of the value.
  
  A #GstPromise is created with [gst.promise.Promise.new_] by the consumer and passed
  to the producer to avoid thread safety issues with the change callback.
  A #GstPromise can be replied to with a value (or an error) by the producer
  with [gst.promise.Promise.reply]. The exact value returned is defined by the API
  contract of the producer and null may be a valid reply.
  [gst.promise.Promise.interrupt] is for the consumer to
  indicate to the producer that the value is not needed anymore and producing
  that value can stop.  The @GST_PROMISE_RESULT_EXPIRED state set by a call
  to [gst.promise.Promise.expire] indicates to the consumer that a value will never
  be produced and is intended to be called by a third party that implements
  some notion of message handling such as #GstBus.
  A callback can also be installed at #GstPromise creation for
  result changes with [gst.promise.Promise.newWithChangeFunc].
  The change callback can be used to chain #GstPromises's together as in the
  following example.
  ```c
  const GstStructure *reply;
  GstPromise *p;
  if (gst_promise_wait (promise) != GST_PROMISE_RESULT_REPLIED)
    return; // interrupted or expired value
  reply = gst_promise_get_reply (promise);
  if (error in reply)
    return; // propagate error
  p = gst_promise_new_with_change_func (another_promise_change_func, user_data, notify);
  pass p to promise-using API
  ```
  
  Each #GstPromise starts out with a #GstPromiseResult of
  [gst.types.PromiseResult.Pending] and only ever transitions once
  into one of the other #GstPromiseResult's.
  
  In order to support multi-threaded code, [gst.promise.Promise.reply],
  [gst.promise.Promise.interrupt] and [gst.promise.Promise.expire] may all be from
  different threads with some restrictions and the final result of the promise
  is whichever call is made first.  There are two restrictions on ordering:
  
  1. That [gst.promise.Promise.reply] and [gst.promise.Promise.interrupt] cannot be called
  after [gst.promise.Promise.expire]
  2. That [gst.promise.Promise.reply] and [gst.promise.Promise.interrupt]
  cannot be called twice.
  
  The change function set with [gst.promise.Promise.newWithChangeFunc] is
  called directly from either the [gst.promise.Promise.reply],
  [gst.promise.Promise.interrupt] or [gst.promise.Promise.expire] and can be called
  from an arbitrary thread.  #GstPromise using APIs can restrict this to
  a single thread or a subset of threads but that is entirely up to the API
  that uses #GstPromise.

    One registry holds the metadata of a set of plugins.
  
  <emphasis role="bold">Design:</emphasis>
  
  The #GstRegistry object is a list of plugins and some functions for dealing
  with them. Each #GstPlugin is matched 1-1 with a file on disk, and may or may
  not be loaded at a given time.
  
  The primary source, at all times, of plugin information is each plugin file
  itself. Thus, if an application wants information about a particular plugin,
  or wants to search for a feature that satisfies given criteria, the primary
  means of doing so is to load every plugin and look at the resulting
  information that is gathered in the default registry. Clearly, this is a time
  consuming process, so we cache information in the registry file. The format
  and location of the cache file is internal to gstreamer.
  
  On startup, plugins are searched for in the plugin search path. The following
  locations are checked in this order:
  
  $(LIST
    * location from --gst-plugin-path commandline option.
    * the GST_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable.
    * the GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH environment variable.
    * default locations (if GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH is not set).
      Those default locations are:
      `$XDG_DATA_HOME/gstreamer-$GST_API_VERSION/plugins/`
      and `$prefix/libs/gstreamer-$GST_API_VERSION/`.
      [$XDG_DATA_HOME](http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) defaults to
      `$HOME/.local/share`.
  )
    
  The registry cache file is loaded from
  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/gstreamer-$GST_API_VERSION/registry-$ARCH.bin`
  (where $XDG_CACHE_HOME defaults to `$HOME/.cache`) or the file listed in the `GST_REGISTRY`
  env var. One reason to change the registry location is for testing.
  
  For each plugin that is found in the plugin search path, there could be 3
  possibilities for cached information:
  
    $(LIST
        * the cache may not contain information about a given file.
        * the cache may have stale information.
        * the cache may have current information.
    )
      
  In the first two cases, the plugin is loaded and the cache updated. In
  addition to these cases, the cache may have entries for plugins that are not
  relevant to the current process. These are marked as not available to the
  current process. If the cache is updated for whatever reason, it is marked
  dirty.
  
  A dirty cache is written out at the end of initialization. Each entry is
  checked to make sure the information is minimally valid. If not, the entry is
  simply dropped.
  
  ## Implementation notes:
  
  The "cache" and "registry" are different concepts and can represent
  different sets of plugins. For various reasons, at init time, the cache is
  stored in the default registry, and plugins not relevant to the current
  process are marked with the [gst.types.PluginFlags.Cached] bit. These plugins are
  removed at the end of initialization.

    This helper structure holds the relevant values for tracking the region of
  interest in a media file, called a segment.
  
  The structure can be used for two purposes:
  
    $(LIST
        * performing seeks (handling seek events)
        * tracking playback regions (handling newsegment events)
    )
      
  The segment is usually configured by the application with a seek event which
  is propagated upstream and eventually handled by an element that performs the seek.
  
  The configured segment is then propagated back downstream with a newsegment event.
  This information is then used to clip media to the segment boundaries.
  
  A segment structure is initialized with [gst.segment.Segment.init_], which takes a #GstFormat
  that will be used as the format of the segment values. The segment will be configured
  with a start value of 0 and a stop/duration of -1, which is undefined. The default
  rate and applied_rate is 1.0.
  
  The public duration field contains the duration of the segment. When using
  the segment for seeking, the start and time members should normally be left
  to their default 0 value. The stop position is left to -1 unless explicitly
  configured to a different value after a seek event.
  
  The current position in the segment should be set by changing the position
  member in the structure.
  
  For elements that perform seeks, the current segment should be updated with the
  [gst.segment.Segment.doSeek] and the values from the seek event. This method will update
  all the segment fields. The position field will contain the new playback position.
  If the start_type was different from GST_SEEK_TYPE_NONE, playback continues from
  the position position, possibly with updated flags or rate.
  
  For elements that want to use #GstSegment to track the playback region,
  update the segment fields with the information from the newsegment event.
  The [gst.segment.Segment.clip] method can be used to check and clip
  the media data to the segment boundaries.
  
  For elements that want to synchronize to the pipeline clock, [gst.segment.Segment.toRunningTime]
  can be used to convert a timestamp to a value that can be used to synchronize
  to the clock. This function takes into account the base as well as
  any rate or applied_rate conversions.
  
  For elements that need to perform operations on media data in stream_time,
  [gst.segment.Segment.toStreamTime] can be used to convert a timestamp and the segment
  info to stream time (which is always between 0 and the duration of the stream).

/**
    A #GstStructure is a collection of key/value pairs. The keys are expressed as
  GQuarks and the values can be of any GType.
  
  In addition to the key/value pairs, a #GstStructure also has a name. The name
  starts with a letter and can be filled by letters, numbers and any of
  "/-_.:".
  
  #GstStructure is used by various GStreamer subsystems to store information in
  a flexible and extensible way. A #GstStructure does not have a refcount
  because it usually is part of a higher level object such as #GstCaps,
  #GstMessage, #GstEvent, #GstQuery. It provides a means to enforce mutability
  using the refcount of the parent with the [gst.structure.Structure.setParentRefcount]
  method.
  
  A #GstStructure can be created with [gst.structure.Structure.newEmpty] or
  [gst.structure.Structure.new_], which both take a name and an optional set of key/value
  pairs along with the types of the values.
  
  Field values can be changed with [gst.structure.Structure.setValue] or
  [gst.structure.Structure.set].
  
  Field values can be retrieved with [gst.structure.Structure.getValue] or the more
  convenient gst_structure_get_*() functions.
  
  Fields can be removed with [gst.structure.Structure.removeField] or
  [gst.structure.Structure.removeFields].
  
  Strings in structures must be ASCII or UTF-8 encoded. Other encodings are not
  allowed. Strings may be null however.
  
  ## The serialization format
  
  GstStructure serialization format serialize the GstStructure name,
  keys/GType/values in a comma separated list with the structure name as first
  field without value followed by separated key/value pairs in the form
  `key=value`, for example:
  
  ```
  a-structure, key=value
  ````
  
  The values type will be inferred if not explicitly specified with the
  `(GTypeName)value` syntax, for example the following struct will have one
  field called 'is-string' which has the string 'true' as a value:
  
  ```
  a-struct, field-is-string=(string)true, field-is-boolean=true
  ```
  
  *Note*: without specifying `(string), `field-is-string` type would have been
  inferred as boolean.
  
  *Note*: we specified `(string)` as a type even if `gchararray` is the actual
  GType name as for convenience some well known types have been aliased or
  abbreviated.
  
  To avoid specifying the type, you can give some hints to the "type system".
  For example to specify a value as a double, you should add a decimal (ie. `1`
  is an [harfbuzz.types.int] while `1.0` is a `double`).
  
  *Note*: when a structure is serialized with #gst_structure_to_string, all
  values are explicitly typed.
  
  Some types have special delimiters:
  
  $(LIST
    * [GstValueArray](GST_TYPE_ARRAY) are inside curly brackets (`{` and `}`).
      For example `a-structure, array={1, 2, 3}`
    * Ranges are inside brackets (`[` and `]`). For example `a-structure,
      range=[1, 6, 2]` 1 being the min value, 6 the maximum and 2 the step. To
      specify a #GST_TYPE_INT64_RANGE you need to explicitly specify it like:
      `a-structure, a-int64-range=(gint64) [1, 5]`
    * [GstValueList](GST_TYPE_LIST) are inside "less and greater than" (`<` and
      `>`). For example `a-structure, list=<1, 2, 3>
  )
    
  Structures are delimited either by a null character `\0` or a semicolon `;`
  the latter allowing to store multiple structures in the same string (see
  #GstCaps).
  
  Quotes are used as "default" delimiters and can be used around any types that
  don't use other delimiters (for example `a-struct, i=(int)"1"`). They are use
  to allow adding spaces or special characters (such as delimiters,
  semicolumns, etc..) inside strings and you can use backslashes `\` to escape
  characters inside them, for example:
  
  ```
  a-struct, special="\"{[(;)]}\" can be used inside quotes"
  ```
  
  They also allow for nested structure, such as:
  
  ```
  a-struct, nested=(GstStructure)"nested-struct, nested=true"
  ```
  
  Since 1.20, nested structures and caps can be specified using brackets (`[`
  and `]`), for example:
  
  ```
  a-struct, nested=[nested-struct, nested=true]
  ```

  > compatibility reason, [gst.structure.Structure.serializeFull] has been added for
  > that purpose.

    Element interface that allows setting of media metadata.
  
  Elements that support changing a stream's metadata will implement this
  interface. Examples of such elements are 'vorbisenc', 'theoraenc' and
  'id3v2mux'.
  
  If you just want to retrieve metadata in your application then all you
  need to do is watch for tag messages on your pipeline's bus. This
  interface is only for setting metadata, not for extracting it. To set tags
  from the application, find tagsetter elements and set tags using e.g.
  [gst.tag_setter.TagSetter.mergeTags] or [gst.tag_setter.TagSetter.addTags]. Also consider
  setting the #GstTagMergeMode that is used for tag events that arrive at the
  tagsetter element (default mode is to keep existing tags).
  The application should do that before the element goes to [gst.types.State.Paused].
  
  Elements implementing the #GstTagSetter interface often have to merge
  any tags received from upstream and the tags set by the application via
  the interface. This can be done like this:
  
  ```c
  GstTagMergeMode merge_mode;
  const GstTagList *application_tags;
  const GstTagList *event_tags;
  GstTagSetter *tagsetter;
  GstTagList *result;
  
  tagsetter = GST_TAG_SETTER (element);
  
  merge_mode = gst_tag_setter_get_tag_merge_mode (tagsetter);
  application_tags = gst_tag_setter_get_tag_list (tagsetter);
  event_tags = (const GstTagList *) element->event_tags;
  
  GST_LOG_OBJECT (tagsetter, "merging tags, merge mode = %d", merge_mode);
  GST_LOG_OBJECT (tagsetter, "event tags: %" GST_PTR_FORMAT, event_tags);
  GST_LOG_OBJECT (tagsetter, "set   tags: %" GST_PTR_FORMAT, application_tags);
  
  result = gst_tag_list_merge (application_tags, event_tags, merge_mode);

    #GstTask is used by #GstElement and #GstPad to provide the data passing
  threads in a #GstPipeline.
  
  A #GstPad will typically start a #GstTask to push or pull data to/from the
  peer pads. Most source elements start a #GstTask to push data. In some cases
  a demuxer element can start a #GstTask to pull data from a peer element. This
  is typically done when the demuxer can perform random access on the upstream
  peer element for improved performance.
  
  Although convenience functions exist on #GstPad to start/pause/stop tasks, it
  might sometimes be needed to create a #GstTask manually if it is not related to
  a #GstPad.
  
  Before the #GstTask can be run, it needs a #GRecMutex that can be set with
  [gst.task.Task.setLock].
  
  The task can be started, paused and stopped with [gst.task.Task.start], [gst.task.Task.pause]
  and [gst.task.Task.stop] respectively or with the [gst.task.Task.setState] function.
  
  A #GstTask will repeatedly call the #GstTaskFunction with the user data
  that was provided when creating the task with [gst.task.Task.new_]. While calling
  the function it will acquire the provided lock. The provided lock is released
  when the task pauses or stops.
  
  Stopping a task with [gst.task.Task.stop] will not immediately make sure the task is
  not running anymore. Use [gst.task.Task.join] to make sure the task is completely
  stopped and the thread is stopped.
  
  After creating a #GstTask, use [gst.object.ObjectGst.unref] to free its resources. This can
  only be done when the task is not running anymore.
  
  Task functions can send a #GstMessage to send out-of-band data to the
  application. The application can receive messages from the #GstBus in its
  mainloop.
  
  For debugging purposes, the task will configure its object name as the thread
  name on Linux. Please note that the object name should be configured before the
  task is started; changing the object name after the task has been started, has
  no effect on the thread name.

    #GstToc functions are used to create/free #GstToc and #GstTocEntry structures.
  Also they are used to convert #GstToc into #GstStructure and vice versa.
  
  #GstToc lets you to inform other elements in pipeline or application that playing
  source has some kind of table of contents (TOC). These may be chapters, editions,
  angles or other types. For example: DVD chapters, Matroska chapters or cue sheet
  TOC. Such TOC will be useful for applications to display instead of just a
  playlist.
  
  Using TOC is very easy. Firstly, create #GstToc structure which represents root
  contents of the source. You can also attach TOC-specific tags to it. Then fill
  it with #GstTocEntry entries by appending them to the #GstToc using
  [gst.toc.Toc.appendEntry], and appending subentries to a #GstTocEntry using
  [gst.toc_entry.TocEntry.appendSubEntry].
  
  Note that root level of the TOC can contain only either editions or chapters. You
  should not mix them together at the same level. Otherwise you will get serialization
  /deserialization errors. Make sure that no one of the entries has negative start and
   stop values.
  
  Use [gst.event.Event.newToc] to create a new TOC #GstEvent, and [gst.event.Event.parseToc] to
  parse received TOC event. Use [gst.event.Event.newTocSelect] to create a new TOC select #GstEvent,
  and [gst.event.Event.parseTocSelect] to parse received TOC select event. The same rule for
  the #GstMessage: [gst.message.Message.newToc] to create new TOC #GstMessage, and
  [gst.message.Message.parseToc] to parse received TOC message.
  
  TOCs can have global scope or current scope. Global scope TOCs contain
  all entries that can possibly be selected using a toc select event, and
  are what an application is usually interested in. TOCs with current scope
  only contain the parts of the TOC relevant to the currently selected/playing
  stream; the current scope TOC is used by downstream elements such as muxers
  to write correct TOC entries when transcoding files, for example. When
  playing a DVD, the global TOC would contain a hierarchy of all titles,
  chapters and angles, for example, while the current TOC would only contain
  the chapters for the currently playing title if playback of a specific
  title was requested.
  
  Applications and plugins should not rely on TOCs having a certain kind of
  structure, but should allow for different alternatives. For example, a
  simple CUE sheet embedded in a file may be presented as a flat list of
  track entries, or could have a top-level edition node (or some other
  alternative type entry) with track entries underneath that node; or even
  multiple top-level edition nodes (or some other alternative type entries)
  each with track entries underneath, in case the source file has extracted
  a track listing from different sources).
