--  == DHCP Client ==
--  The DHCP client can be used to configure the IPv4 network stack by using
--  the DHCP protocol (RFC 2131).  The DHCP client uses a UDP socket on port 68
--  to send and receive DHCP messages.  The DHCP client state is maintained by
--  two procedures which are called asynchronously: the <tt>Process</tt>
--  and <tt>Receive</tt> procedures.  The <tt>Process</tt> procedure is responsible
--  for sending requests to the DHCP server and to manage the timeouts used for
--  the retransmissions, renewal and lease expiration.  On its hand, the <tt>Receive</tt>
--  procedure is called by the UDP socket layer when a DHCP packet is received.
--  These two procedures are typically called from different tasks.
--
--  To make the implementation simple and ready to use, the DHCP client uses a pre-defined
--  configuration that should meet most requirements.  The DHCP client asks for the following
--  DHCP options:
--
--  * Option 1: Subnetmask
--  * Option 3: Router
--  * Option 6: Domain name server
--  * Option 12: Hostname
--  * Option 15: Domain name
--  * Option 26: Interface MTU size
--  * Option 28: Brodcast address
--  * Option 42: NTP server
--  * Option 72: WWW server
--  * Option 51: Lease time
--  * Option 58: Renew time
--  * Option 59: Rebind time
--
--  It sends the following options to help the server identify the client:
--
--  * Option 60: Vendor class identifier, the string "Ada Embedded Network" is sent.
--  * Option 61: Client identifier, the Ethernet address is used as identifier.
--
--  === Initialization ===
--  To use the client, one will have to declare a global aliased DHCP client instance
--  (the aliased is necessary as the UDP socket layer needs to get an access to it):
--
--    C : aliased Net.DHCP.Client;
--
--  The DHCP client instance must then be initialized after the network interface
--  is initialized.  The <tt>Initialize</tt> procedure needs an access to the interface
--  instance.
--
--    C.Initialize (Ifnet'Access);
--
--  The initialization only binds the UDP socket to the port 68 and prepares the DHCP
--  state machine.  At this stage, no DHCP packet is sent yet but the UDP socket is now
--  able to receive them.
--
--  === Processing ===
--  The <tt>Process</tt> procedure must be called either by a main task or by a dedicated
--  task to send the DHCP requests and maintain the DHCP state machine.  Each time this
--  procedure is called, it looks whether some DHCP processing must be done and it computes
--  a deadline that indicates the time for the next call.  It is safe
--  to call the <tt>Process</tt> procedure more often than required.  The operation will
--  perform different operations depending on the DHCP state:
--
--  In the <tt>STATE_INIT</tt> state, it records the begining of the DHCP discovering state,
--  switches to the <tt>STATE_SELECTING</tt> and sends the first DHCP discover packet.
--
--  When the DHCP state machine is in the <tt>STATE_SELECTING</tt> state, it continues to
--  send the DHCP discover packet taking into account the backoff timeout.
--
--  In the <tt>STATE_REQUESTING</tt> state, it sends the DHCP request packet to the server.
--
--  In the <tt>STATE_BOUND</tt> state, it configures the interface if it is not yet configured
--  and it then waits for the DHCP lease renewal.  If the DHCP lease must be renewed, it
--  switches to the <tt>STATE_RENEWING</tt> state.
--

--
--  The DHCP client does not use any task to give you the freedom on how you want to integrate
--  the DHCP client in your application.  The <tt>Process</tt> procedure may be integrated in
--  a loop similar to the loop below:
--
--    declare
--       Dhcp_Deadline : Ada.Real_Time.Time;
--    begin
--       loop
--          C.Process (Dhcp_Deadline);
--          delay until Dhcp_Deadline;
--       end loop;
--    end;
--
--  This loop may be part of a dedicated task for the DHCP client but it may also be part
--  of another task that could also handle other network house keeping (such as ARP management).
--
--  === Interface Configuration ===
--  Once in the <tt>STATE_BOUND</tt>, the interface configuration is done by the <tt>Process</tt>
--  procedure that calls the <tt>Bind</tt> procedure with the DHCP received options.
--  This procedure configures the interface IP, netmask, gateway, MTU and DNS.  It is possible
--  to override this procedure in an application to be notified and extract other information
--  from the received DHCP options.  In that case, it is still important to call the overriden
--  procedure so that the interface and network stack is correctly configured.
